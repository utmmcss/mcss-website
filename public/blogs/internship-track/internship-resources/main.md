##Creating a Technical resume


####Example of a bad resume for CS internships

![Bad Resume](BLOGROOT/img/badresume.png)

#####Reasons
* If you are applying to a software engineer, data science or even program manager position. Do not mention that you have skills with power point, word etc. This is a common mistake in resumes. 
* Do not include anything that is not relevant to a technical role. For example, you can leave out that you worked as a cashier in wal-mart. 
* Very little in this resume is relevant for a technical role. 
* Mentioning that you won an app contest is good but more details about the app and how it was built is a must. 


####Example of a good resume for CS Internships with no industry experience. 

![Good Resume](BLOGROOT/img/goodresume.png)

#####Reasons
* Contains relevant details about technical skills
* Includes grades from relevant courses
* Includes relevant extra curriculars
* One page only

The above resume is from a real person who is in first year. The projects are all from high school assignments. You should follow this example if you lack personal projects or industry experience.
