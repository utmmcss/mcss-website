Hello students!

This year, I’d like for you to get the start to CS university life that you deserve. 

##Getting Motivated about CS
It’s a wonderful feeling to be motivated about what you’re learning. I use Youtube to remind myself of why I find computer science fascinating. I recommend that you watch these videos with your fellow students as motivating content. 

####Computerphile
The guests on Computerphile have an enthusiasm for computers that can be contagious.

####PBS Crash Course Computer Science
This playlist is accessible to people of all ages and goes into a surprising amount of technical detail for a children’s computer science show. I have often used this channel as a guide that provides context for when the content as its taught by professors becomes far too technical.

##Let’s learn about Health
I’ve observed students including myself sacrifice components of my health, for example sleep, nutrition, exercise, community and play. From what I have seen, having individuals take ownership of their health is the only sustainable solution to reaping the rewards associated with optimal health.

####What I’ve Learned
A good way to start taking ownership is learning the latest science around optimal living. I like this channel because it gives you health advice from the latest scientific journals condensed for you to take actionable steps towards improving your health.

##Internships
I’ve had the opportunity to broaden my perspective and travel the world while sharpening my technical skills because of my internships. It would make me happy to have many more students grow in this manner. These resources will help you get the internship you want: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11zgd7rl9bimzh-2R4dDid7wtZui_dNIHCWQdUk23LVY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Internship Resources</a>


##Fostering a healthy learning community
A good indicator of whether or not you truly understand something is whether or not you can teach it to somebody. Integrating this into your academic life can benefit the understanding of you and your peers. Share your knowledge and your resources to foster a healthier learning community.
