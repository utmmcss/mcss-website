Creating a Technical resume
Example of a bad resume for CS internships

Reasons
If you are applying to a software engineer, data science or even program manager position. Do not mention that you have skills with power point, word etc. This is a common mistake in resumes. 
Do not include anything that is not relevant to a technical role. For example, you can leave out that you worked as a cashier in wal-mart. 
Very little in this resume is relevant for a technical role. 
Mentioning that you won an app contest is good but more details about the app and how it was built is a must.
