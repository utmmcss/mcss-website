##How to manage events
Go to [hostname]/admin and sign in with a Google account. It will probably deny your credentials if you haven't been added as an admin. Due to the way that Firebase claims work, admins must be added via a Python script included in the repo.
<br>
<br>
Go to the Firebase console and download a service key and put it in the root directory of this repo. **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT PUSH THIS FILE! ADD IT TO .gitignore!!!
<br>
<br>
Run the file and enter the email of the user to promote (or demote) and follow the instructions.
